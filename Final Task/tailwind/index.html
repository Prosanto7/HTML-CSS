          Reimagining social media through the power of the blockchain.

          We are creating social media 3.0 with influencers, celebrities and
          creators being able to launch their own digital currency by simply
          creating a profile with media content posted as Non fungible Tokens
          that can be owned and traded on the Tokners network

              Creators can gain independence through a decentralised digital
              currency system that is dependent on growing and engaging with the
              community and also their star power. They own 10-15% of the total
              value of the tokens minted.

              Holding social tokens allows the individual to gain access to
              benefits including unreleased content, private communities, direct
              access to celebrity, early-access to tickets and more as well as
              the ability to trade with other communities in order to gain
              access to more creator content with early token buyers being the
              biggest winners as the value of the token increases with more
              buyers.

              We would get them on our platform and they would see the

              digital content can be traded as NFTs and their most loyal fans

              Bitcoin was the first, and it has since grown to thousands of
              tokens launched all aiming to fix one problem or the other with
              some quite simply FOMOing the moment. Our goal is to bring mass
              adoption to the cryptocurrency space by dumbing it down. How far
              down? So down that even a celebrity can explain it in simple words
              to their followers and have them download an app, buy into the
              social currency of their favourite person and watch their
              investment as is with other cryptocurrency project.
            </p>

            <p>
              We are trying to do to this space what investment apps did for the
              "nonexistent retail investors". We are gamefying digital currency,
              bringing in popular faces instead of hard to understand projects
              to make it the norm and inadvertently being the "gateway drug" for
              a lot of people to finally give this space a real look.

              There would be new markets and advertisers with little to offer
              would not find home there. Like Kanye said, "Personalities would
              become the new currency, and services would be built on top of
              them". Well, Kanye didn't exactly say that, but it sounds like
              something we hope he would say.

              would people like you on the money, and you would own it because
              it would make the most sense in the world.
